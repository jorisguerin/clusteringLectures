# Clustering lectures

## Description

This repository contains all the material used during my lectures about clustering at INSA Toulouse (November 2021).
The objective is to get started about different unsupervised machine learning algorithms.
- Colleagues, feel free to use this material for your own lectures.
- Students, feel free to use this material to learn about the basics of unsupervised learnings and improve your general knowledge about data science

## Organization

This repository is organized as follows:
- All the necessary python packages can be installed using __conda__ and the _environment.yml_ file provided in this repo.
- The slides are under the __Lectures__ directory. They were intended to be used as jupyter notebook presentations using __RISE__. Recommended order:
  1. Intro
  2. Kmeans
  3. Agglomerative clustering
  4. NMF
- The __Hands on__ directory contains exercises to practice the notions presented during the lectures. The students are expected to follow the _pdf_ files and try to study the data themselves. A proposal of solution is also proposed for each exercise.
